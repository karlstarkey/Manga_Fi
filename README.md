Manga_Fi is an advanced AI-driven platform that crafts personalized manga-style profile pictures (PFPs) for X users. Leveraging cutting-edge AI algorithms and seamless integration with the X API, Manga_Fi transforms user interactions into visually stunning, manga-inspired avatars. Designed for anime and manga enthusiasts, this program brings the artistry of manga directly to your social media presence.

## Features

- **Dynamic X Integration**: Automatically monitors and processes user tweets in real-time to generate responses and deliver PFPs.
- **Sophisticated Image Generation Pipeline**: Utilizes multi-layered AI models combining generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion techniques to produce high-quality, manga-style artwork.
- **Adaptive Styling**: AI analyzes user input and X metadata (e.g., profile bio, activity) to tailor PFP designs uniquely for each individual.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modular components for performance and scalability, ensuring fast response times even under heavy user interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- X API credentials for integration
- Docker (for optional containerized deployment)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OtakuAI.git
   cd Manga_Fi
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up your `.env` file with the following keys:
   ```
   X_API_KEY=your_api_key
   X_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up Redis for task queuing:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name Manga_Fi-redis -p 6379:6379 redis
   ```
4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Key Functionalities

Manga_Fi doesn't just create images—it understands the user. By analyzing tweet content and user metadata, it tailors the PFP to match the user’s mood, interests, and personality. Our advanced pipeline ensures simultaneous handling of multiple user requests. Built-in queuing and prioritization logic allow efficient processing without delays. It supports various manga aesthetics, including Shounen (action-packed), Shoujo (romantic and soft), Seinen (mature and detailed), and Chibi (adorable and cartoony). Every generated PFP feeds back into the AI’s learning module, enhancing its ability to refine styles and adapt to user preferences.
