   - Suggestions for fixing the issue (if applicable).

3. **Response Time**:  
   We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **48 hours**. Depending on the complexity of the issue, we will keep you updated on progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

To protect the Otaku AI community, we request that you do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to address them. We will work with you to ensure that the issue is resolved and credit you for your discovery (if you wish).

## Scope
